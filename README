# FreedomGrok v6 — Universal Black Budget & Kleptocracy Hunter  
**Currency-agnostic · Cryptocurrency-native · Near-zero false positives**  
*A fully autonomous, distributed, machine-learning-powered watchdog for covert financial flows across fiat and blockchain networks.*

### What It Does

FreedomGrok v6 continuously monitors financial transaction streams (fiat + crypto) in real time and flags patterns that are characteristic of:

- Black-budget programs  
- State-actor slush funds  
- Kleptocratic laundering networks  
- Sanctioned-entity financing  
- Covert influence operations  
- Offshore “cutout” entity chains  

It combines:
- Unsupervised autoencoder anomaly detection (PyTorch + Ray on GPU)
- Heuristic “cutout” scoring (shell-company naming, offshore jurisdictions, privacy-coin usage, etc.)
- Dynamic state-actor reputation tracking (Redis)
- Custom rule engine (safe-eval expressions)
- Honey-account trap detection
- Friday-night / round-number / large-transfer clustering

All logic is currency-agnostic and works with USD, EUR, CHF, CNY, RUB, AED, crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XMR, etc.), and any future currency you add.

### Architecture Overview

```
Kafka → FreedomGrok v6 → Ray/GPU Detector → Redis (state) → SMTP Alerts + Prometheus metrics
          ↑                   ↑
      HashiCorp Vault     FastAPI /metrics endpoint
```

- **Distributed detection** via Ray (scales to multiple GPUs/nodes)  
- **Secrets** stored in HashiCorp Vault (Fernet + HMAC keys)  
- **Real-time streaming** from Kafka  
- **Alert throttling** + batching for performance  
- **API + metrics** (/health, /stats, /metrics for Prometheus)

### Quick Start (Docker recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/FreedomGrok-v6.git
cd FreedomGrok-v6

# 1. Create .env (see .env.example)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Fill in your secrets:
#    VAULT_URL, VAULT_TOKEN, SMTP_*, API_TOKEN, etc.

# 3. Run with Docker Compose (includes Kafka, Redis, Vault dev server)
docker-compose up --build

# The hunter will start automatically in streaming mode.
# To run only the API:  python FreedomGrokv6.txt api
```

### Manual / Development Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # (create this from the imports)

# Export environment variables or use .env + python-dotenv
export $(cat .env | xargs)

# Run the hunter
python FreedomGrokv6.txt

# Or run API only
python FreedomGrokv6.txt api
```

### Configuration Files

| File                     | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `blackbudget_rules.json` | Custom boolean expressions (safe-eval) for high-precision triggers     |
| `cutouts.json`           | Offshore/shell-company patterns (override or extend defaults)          |
| `honey_accounts.json`    | List of known investigator-controlled accounts/wallets (triggers alert) |
| `.env`                   | All secrets and connection strings                                      |

Example `blackbudget_rules.json` snippet:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Sudden 50 BTC to Monero mixer on Friday night",
    "condition": "is_crypto and currency == 'BTC' and amount >= 40 and amount <= 60 and friday_night and cutout_score > 0.7"
  }
]
```

### Exposed Endpoints

| Endpoint      | Method | Auth       | Description                              |
|---------------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `/health`     | GET    | none       | Returns `{"status":"healthy",...}`       |
| `/stats`      | GET    | Bearer token | Processed records, signals, TPS          |
| `/metrics`    | GET    | none       | Prometheus metrics (records, anomalies…) |
